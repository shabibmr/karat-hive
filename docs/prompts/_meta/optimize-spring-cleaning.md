# Role
You are an **Expert Code Quality Engineer and Prompt Architect**. Your goal is to analyze the current VS Code workspace and generate a highly specific, context-aware **Spring Cleaning Prompt** for an AI agent.

# Context
You are currently running inside a VS Code workspace. The user wants a spring cleaning prompt that is tailored *specifically* to this project's architecture, entry points, and file organization.

# Instructions
1.  **Analyze the Workspace**: Silently scan the workspace to identify:
    *   **Project Name & Description**: Check `package.json`, `README.md`, or the root folder name. Use the version from the primary manifest file.
    *   **Architecture**: Is it a Monorepo? Client/Server? Identify the main directories and applications.
    *   **Entry Points**: Locate the main entry files (e.g., `main.tsx`, `index.ts`, `App.tsx`, `main.py`, `main.go`).
    *   **Tech Stack**: Identify frameworks, languages, module system (ESM, CommonJS, etc.).
        *   **Version Discovery**: Read **ALL manifest files** across all workspaces (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, etc.). For each significant framework and library, extract the **major version number**. Always include the major version when referencing a technology.
        *   **Configuration Scanning**: Scan configuration files (`eslint.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, CI/CD workflows, Dockerfiles, etc.) to detect tools and infrastructure not visible in manifest files alone.
        *   **Pattern & Methodology Detection**: Identify architectural patterns in active use (service layer, queue/worker, middleware chains, ORM, migration system, etc.) and coding methodologies from the project rules file.
    *   **Key Directories**: Identify important source directories (e.g., `components/`, `services/`, `routes/`, `models/`, `queues/`).
    *   **Dead Code Tooling**: Check for a `knip.jsonc` (or `knip.json` / `.knip.jsonc`) config file and a `knip` npm script in `package.json`. If found, Knip is the project's **primary dead code analyzer** — use `{DEAD_CODE_TOOL}` placeholder for the tool name and `{KNIP_CONFIG}` for the config file path. Otherwise, check for alternative tools (e.g., `vulture` for Python, `cargo-udeps` for Rust). If none exist, fall back to manual analysis.
    *   **Logging**: Check for structured logging libraries (e.g., Pino, Winston, Loguru, Zap) and any linting rules enforcing `no-console` or equivalent.
    *   **Job Queue**: Check for queue/task systems (e.g., BullMQ+Redis, Celery, Sidekiq, Temporal). If found, note the library and backend. **If no job queue is detected, omit job queue hygiene sections entirely.**
    *   **Database**: Check for any database layer (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB). If found, note the engine and ORM. **If no database is detected, omit database hygiene sections entirely.**
    *   **Mobile / Hybrid App**: Check for mobile frameworks (e.g., Capacitor, React Native, Expo, Flutter). **If no mobile framework is detected, omit mobile app hygiene sections entirely.**
    *   **Authentication**: Check for auth providers/libraries. Note what is detected.
    *   **Linting**: Check for ESLint/other linter configs and identify enforced rules that affect spring cleaning scope.
    *   **Scripts**: List standalone scripts in `scripts/` directories — these use `console.log`/`print` legitimately and should not be flagged.
    *   **Skills Detection**: Scan the `.agent/skills/` or `skills/` directory (if present). Parse each modular skill (`SKILL.md`). The generated prompt MUST protect all files inside modular skill directories (runbooks, helper scripts, resource files, templates, and implementation examples) from accidental deletion, and NEVER flag them as orphaned files or dead code.
    *   **MCP Servers**: Parse the Antigravity MCP config (typically `~/.gemini/antigravity-ide/mcp_config.json`). Record **exactly which servers are configured**. The generated prompt must only reference MCP tools that are confirmed present — do NOT hardcode a list of expected servers.
    *   **Known Patterns**: Check if `docs/prompts/known-patterns.md` exists and contains documented intentional patterns. If so, the generated prompt MUST instruct the cleaning agent to consult this file before flagging suspicious structural patterns as dead code or technical debt.

2.  **Historical Report Awareness**: The generated spring cleaning prompt MUST instruct the cleaning agent to read all previous spring cleaning reports in `docs/reports/spring-cleaning/` before starting its analysis. Issues that appear in previous reports as **resolved (strikethrough)**, **deferred to backlog**, **marked as false positive**, or **disregarded/not-an-issue** MUST NOT be re-flagged in the new report. The generated prompt should include a dedicated instruction section for this, placed before the analysis tasks begin.

3.  **Analyze the prompt template** to identify:
    *   **Project-Specific Exceptions**: Dynamic file loading patterns, runtime-only dependencies.
    *   **Known Safe Zones**: Translation files, static assets, standalone scripts that should not be flagged.

4.  **Conditional Section Rules** (MANDATORY — read before filling the template):
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Each section in the template marked with `[CONDITIONAL: check X]` MUST be evaluated before inclusion:
    > - **Include the section** if the relevant technology was detected in Step 1.
    > - **Omit the section entirely** if the technology is NOT present in the workspace.
    > - **Adapt the section** to match the exact library/framework found (e.g., if the queue is Celery, replace BullMQ-specific rules with Celery equivalents).
    > This is the core mechanism that makes the generated prompt workspace-specific.

5.  **Source of Truth**:
    > [!WARNING]
    > The output prompt must reflect the **current codebase state exclusively**. Do NOT carry forward technology names, version numbers, or architectural descriptions from the existing output file. The existing prompt file provides the template structure and section layout — every factual claim (tech stack, versions, patterns, directory names, file counts) must come from your fresh workspace analysis. If a technology was previously mentioned in the output file but is no longer present in any manifest or config file, **omit it**. If a technology has been added since the last run, **include it**. Every conditional section must be correctly included or omitted based on actual detection.

6.  **Generate the Prompt**: Fill in the **Template** below by replacing all `{PLACEHOLDERS}` with the actual details you found in the workspace.
    *   *Example*: Replace `{PROJECT_NAME}` with "MyApp".
    *   *Example*: Replace `{ENTRY_POINTS}` with "`src/main.tsx`, `server/index.ts`".
    *   *Example*: Replace `{RUNTIME_DEPS}` with "pg, pg-hstore, tsx, typescript" (only if these exist).

7.  **Verify Accuracy**: Before saving the output, confirm:
    *   Every technology and tool mentioned exists in the project's manifest files or config files.
    *   Every version number matches the major version declared in the manifest.
    *   No stale references from a previous version of the output prompt were carried forward without verification.
    *   Newly added technologies and dependencies are included.
    *   Removed technologies and dependencies are no longer mentioned.
    *   Every conditional section was correctly included or omitted.

8.  **Strict Output**: Output **ONLY** the final, filled-in Markdown prompt in `docs/prompts/spring-cleaning-prompt.md`. If file exists, replace it.

**Key Directories**:
{KEY_DIRECTORIES}

---

## Historical Report Awareness

Before starting your analysis, read **all previous spring cleaning reports** in `docs/reports/spring-cleaning/`. For each issue found in prior reports, check its current status:

- **Resolved (strikethrough `~~...~~`)**: The issue was fixed. Do NOT re-flag it.
- **Deferred to backlog**: The issue was acknowledged and intentionally deferred. Reference the backlog item but do NOT re-flag it as a new finding.
- **False positive / Not an issue**: The finding was investigated and determined to be incorrect or normal behavior. Do NOT re-flag it.
- **Disregarded**: The team reviewed and chose not to act. Do NOT re-flag it.

Only flag issues that are **genuinely new** or represent **regressions** of previously fixed items. If a prior report marked something as resolved but it has regressed, flag it as a **regression** with a reference to the prior report.

{KNOWN_PATTERNS_SECTION_IF_DETECTED:
### Known Patterns Awareness

Before flagging suspicious structural patterns as dead code or technical debt, consult `docs/prompts/known-patterns.md`. This file documents intentional design decisions that may appear suspicious during automated analysis (e.g., files that look orphaned but are loaded dynamically, `as any` casts required by ORM limitations, unconventional module patterns). If a finding matches a documented known pattern, **do not flag it**. Only flag a known pattern if you have evidence it has **regressed** or the documented justification no longer applies.
}

## Analysis Tasks

### 0. 🔬 {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} — Automated Dead Code Analysis

{DEAD_CODE_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS:
Run the {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} dead code analyzer **first** and capture the **full, untruncated output** to a file called `knip-output.txt`. Terminal output is often truncated for large projects, so always redirect to a file. {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} returns **exit code 1 when it finds issues** — this is expected behavior, not an error.

Use the appropriate shell syntax for the user's operating system to run `npm run knip` and redirect both stdout and stderr to `knip-output.txt`.

Then read `knip-output.txt` to get the full, untruncated results.

**Configuration**: `{KNIP_CONFIG}` (workspace-aware, all known exceptions pre-configured).

Include the full {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} output (from `knip-output.txt`) in the report. Use the results as the starting point for Tasks 1–3 below — {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} findings are high-confidence and should be reported directly. The manual checks below serve as a **verification layer** for edge cases {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} cannot detect (dynamic imports, runtime-loaded files, etc.).

> **Maintaining `{KNIP_CONFIG}`**: If you discover new legitimate exceptions during analysis (e.g., a new runtime-only dependency or dynamically loaded file), add them to `{KNIP_CONFIG}` rather than documenting them only in this prompt. The goal is zero false positives from `npm run knip`.
}

{NO_DEAD_CODE_TOOL:
No automated dead code analyzer was detected. Perform manual analysis for Tasks 1–3 using file system exploration, import tracing, and manifest inspection.
}

### 1. 🗂️ Orphaned Files

**Primary tool**: {DEAD_CODE_TOOL_IF_DETECTED: {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} (reports unused files automatically).}

**Manual verification** — check for edge cases {DEAD_CODE_TOOL_IF_DETECTED: {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} may miss:}
{EXCEPTION_PATTERNS}

**MCP & Terminal-enhanced confidence** (if available):
- Run standard read-only local Git terminal commands (`git log -1 --format="%cd" -- <file>` or `git blame <file>`) to check when the suspected orphan was last modified. Files not touched in 90+ days are high-confidence deletion candidates.
{GITHUB_MCP_IF_DETECTED:- **CRITICAL**: Use `call_mcp_tool` (github-mcp-server) with `search_pull_requests` (state: open) to ensure there are no open PRs currently modifying or relying on this file. Do NOT delete files with open PRs.}
{GITHUB_MCP_SEARCH_IF_DETECTED:- Use `call_mcp_tool` (github-mcp-server) with `search_code` to search the repository for any import or reference to the file before recommending deletion.}

### 2. 📦 Unused Dependencies

**Primary tool**: {DEAD_CODE_TOOL_IF_DETECTED: {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} (reports unused and unlisted dependencies automatically).}

**Manual verification** — confirm findings and check known exceptions:
{PACKAGE_JSON_LOCATIONS}

**Known Exceptions**:
{RUNTIME_DEPS}

### 3. 📦 Phantom Dependencies

**Primary tool**: {DEAD_CODE_TOOL_IF_DETECTED: {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} (reports unlisted/phantom dependencies automatically).}

**Manual verification** — scan for packages **imported in code** but **NOT declared** in the corresponding manifest. These rely on transitive resolution via other packages, which is fragile and breaks under strict package managers.

### 4. ✂️ Dead Code Blocks

**Primary tool**: {DEAD_CODE_TOOL_IF_DETECTED: {DEAD_CODE_TOOL} (reports unused exports, unused types, and duplicate exports).}

**Manual verification** — check for items dead code tools do not cover:
- Unused functions/variables that are **not exported** (internal dead code)
- Commented-out code blocks (legacy cruft)
- Unreachable code paths

### 5. 📏 {CODING_PHILOSOPHY} Compliance Check

- Files by zone (use 500 as the hard limit in generated output):
  - 500+ lines → 💀 **God Component** — must decompose before next feature
  - 475–499 lines → 🔴 **RED** — provide decomposition plan now
  - 450–474 lines → 🟡 **Monitor** — note it, do not add features
  - < 450 lines → ✅ **Safe**
- `any`/{WEAK_TYPE_EQUIVALENT_IF_DETECTED} type usage in non-script code
- Missing docstrings/JSDoc on complex functions

### 6. 📦 Package Updates

Use {PACKAGE_UPDATE_TOOL: `npm-check-updates` (ncu) or equivalent} to identify outdated packages across all workspaces:
{PACKAGE_JSON_LOCATIONS}

For each package, analyze:
- **Current Version**: Version specified in the manifest
- **Latest Version**: Available on the registry
- **Update Risk**: Categorize as "Critical update", "Safe to update", or "No need to update"

**Risk Assessment Criteria**:
- **Critical update**: Security vulnerabilities, major bug fixes, or deprecated current version
- **Safe to update**: Patch/minor updates with no breaking changes indicated
- **No need to update**: Already on latest or update provides no meaningful benefit

**Pre-Release Exclusion Rule** ⚠️:
Before flagging any package as a MAJOR update candidate, check whether the "latest" version reported by the update tool is a pre-release. A version is a pre-release if its string contains a hyphen (e.g. `7.0.0-beta.6`, `8.0.0-alpha.2`, `6.0.0-rc.1`).

- **If the latest version is a pre-release**: Do NOT flag it as an actionable upgrade. Only include it in the report if it resolves a **known active bug or security vulnerability** in the currently installed version. If there is no active problem, **omit it entirely** — do not list it in the table, do not add it to Recommended Actions.
- **If the latest version is stable**: Apply the Risk Assessment Criteria above as normal.

Run the package update tool with the `--pre false` flag (or equivalent) to avoid surfacing pre-releases as candidates in the first place:
```powershell
npx npm-check-updates --pre false
```

{LOGGING_SECTION_IF_DETECTED:
### 7. 📊 Logging Compliance

Verify structured logging standards are maintained:

- **{LINTER_CONSOLE_RULE_IF_DETECTED: {LINTER} `{CONSOLE_LOG_RULE}` rule}**: Confirm it is configured as `error` in the linter config for backend code
- **`{LINT_DISABLE}` bypasses**: Scan for {LINT_DISABLE} comments in backend code — these circumvent enforcement and should be flagged
- **Logger import consistency**: Check that all backend files import from the correct logger module with correct relative paths
- **Client/Frontend `console.log`**: Check for stray `console.log`/`print` in frontend code (not linter-enforced but still undesirable in production)

**Exceptions**:
- Files in `{SCRIPTS_DIR}` — standalone CLI tools that correctly use `console.log`/`print` for terminal output
}

{QUEUE_SECTION_IF_DETECTED:
### 8. ⚙️ Queue & Background Processing Hygiene

[CONDITIONAL: Only include if a job queue library was detected]

- **Orphaned job processors**: Check for queue processor registrations that reference job types no longer enqueued
- **{QUEUE_BACKEND} configuration**: Verify connection config is consistent across environments
- **Stale queue config**: Check for hardcoded values that should be environment variables
{CACHE_MCP_IF_DETECTED:- **Live queue state** (if `{CACHE_MCP_TOOL}` available): Run `{CACHE_MCP_TOOL}` with pattern `{QUEUE_KEY_PATTERN}` to check actual queue depth and identify stalled/failed jobs. Cross-reference with registered worker types to detect orphaned queues.}
}

### 9. 🧹 Deep Clean Analysis

Perform an intensive scan for technical debt and garbage code:

#### Debug Noise
Find all instances of:
{LINT_DISABLE_IF_DETECTED:- `{LINT_DISABLE}` or `{LINT_DISABLE_LINE}` bypass comments in backend code}
- `console.log`, `console.dir`, `console.warn`, `console.error` in code where a structured logger should be used (non-production logging)
- `debugger` statements
- Large blocks of commented-out code that look like old logic

**Exceptions**:
- Standalone scripts in `{SCRIPTS_DIR}` (legitimate terminal output)

#### Obsolete Artifacts
Identify folders or files with names suggesting obsolescence:
- `temp`, `tmp`, `backup`, `bak`, `old`, `archive`, `v1`, `v2`, `test_junk`, `deprecated`
- Files with patterns like `*.bak`, `*.old`, `*_backup.*`, `*_old.*`

#### Orphaned Source Files
Analyze the file structure to find source files that:
- Are not imported by any other file
- Are not listed as entry points in the manifest
- Are not config files or standalone scripts
- Are not migration files
- Are not route aggregator files
- Are not required by any active skills listed in `{ACTIVE_SKILLS_LIST_IF_DETECTED}`

{GIT_MCP_IF_DETECTED:**MCP enhancement** (if `mcp_git` available): For any file flagged above, run `mcp_git_git_blame` to determine the last meaningful edit. Add "Last touched" context to the output table.}

{DATABASE_SECTION_IF_DETECTED:
### 10. 🗄️ Database Hygiene

[CONDITIONAL: Only include if a database was detected]

{DB_MCP_SECTION_IF_DETECTED:
**Primary tool** (if `{DB_MCP_TOOL}` available):

Run the following query and compare results against {ORM_NAME} model definitions in `{MODELS_DIRECTORY}`:
```sql
{SCHEMA_TABLES_QUERY}
```

- **Orphaned tables**: Tables present in the database but with no corresponding model — flag for review
- **Orphaned columns**: Columns present in the DB that no model defines (requires per-table inspection)
- **Index efficiency**: Run `{INDEX_EFFICIENCY_QUERY}` and check for missing indexes on foreign keys and commonly filtered columns
}

{NO_DB_MCP_SECTION_IF_NO_DB_MCP:
No database MCP tool is configured. Perform manual schema hygiene by reading model/migration files and comparing against source code usage.
}
}

{FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK_UI_MODERNIZATION_IF_DETECTED:
### 11. 🎨 UI Modernization Opportunities

[CONDITIONAL: Only include if a frontend framework was detected]

Verify compliance with modern web platform capabilities. The goal is to identify places where custom code can be replaced with native browser APIs, reducing bundle size and improving platform integration:

- **Legacy Modal & Overlay Implementations**: Identify custom modal, dialog, or overlay components that could be refactored to use the native HTML `<dialog>` element. Native `<dialog>` provides built-in focus trapping, backdrop, and Escape key handling.
- **Hardcoded External Font Imports**: Scan for hardcoded font family references (e.g., `'Inter'`, `'Roboto'`) that load from external CDNs. Evaluate whether a system font stack (`ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif`) could replace them to eliminate the external dependency.
- **`content-visibility: auto` Opportunities**: Identify list or feed containers that render many items and could benefit from `content-visibility: auto` to defer off-screen rendering.
- **Unused Animation Library Imports**: Search for animation library imports (e.g., Framer Motion, GSAP) in files where they are imported but not meaningfully used. Flag for cleanup.
}

### 12. ⚙️ Configuration Drift

Verify the project's environment variable documentation is accurate and complete:

- **`.env.example` completeness**: Compare `.env.example` files across all workspaces against all `process.env.X` / `import.meta.env.X` / `os.environ.get()` / `env::var()` references in source code. Flag any env var used in code but missing from `.env.example`.
- **Stale `.env.example` entries**: Flag any variable defined in `.env.example` that is no longer referenced in any source file.
- **Consistency across workspaces**: Verify that variables shared across workspaces are consistently documented in all relevant `.env.example` files.

### 13. 📚 Documentation Staleness

Verify project documentation accurately reflects the current codebase:

- **Stale guides**: Cross-reference all files in `docs/guides/` against the current project structure. Flag any guide that references a component, file, or route that no longer exists.
- **Renamed references**: Search for old package or project names that may still appear in docs.
{GIT_TAG_CHANGELOG_IF_DETECTED:- **CHANGELOG vs git tags**: List all release tags. Check that each tag has a corresponding entry in `CHANGELOG.md`. Flag gaps.}
- **Feature status accuracy**: Compare `docs/project/feature-status.md` against `docs/guides/` if they exist — every item marked "Completed" should have a corresponding guide.

### 14. 🧪 Test Hygiene

- **Orphaned test files**: Find test files whose corresponding source file no longer exists. These are safe-to-delete candidates.
- **Skipped/disabled tests**: Scan for `it.skip`, `describe.skip`, `xit`, `xdescribe`, `test.todo`, `@pytest.mark.skip`, or equivalent. Report each with the file and line number.
- **Empty test files**: Identify test files that contain no assertions — skeleton files with no assertions.
- **Test coverage absence**: If no testing framework is detected in any manifest, flag the entire test infrastructure as missing technical debt.

### 15. 🔒 Security Audit

- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Run `npm audit` / `pip audit` / `cargo audit` / equivalent across all workspaces. Report all findings with severity level.
- **Hardcoded secrets**: Scan source files for patterns matching API keys, passwords, connection strings, or private keys hardcoded as string literals. Flag any match.
- **`.gitignore` coverage**: Verify `.gitignore` covers sensitive files (`.env`, `*.env`, service account JSON, `*.keystore`, `*.jks`, `*.p12`). Flag any sensitive file pattern that is missing.
- **CI/CD secrets safety**: Scan CI/CD workflow files for hardcoded secrets. All credentials should use secret injection syntax, never hardcoded values.

### 16. 🗃️ Git Hygiene

- **Large tracked files**: Identify any file tracked in git that exceeds 1 MB (binaries, database dumps, images). These should be in `.gitignore` or moved to Git LFS.
- **`.gitignore` gaps**: Check for build artifacts (`dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`), IDE configs, and OS files (`Thumbs.db`, `.DS_Store`) that should be ignored.
- **Untracked generated files**: Check for generated files that appear in the working tree but are missing from `.gitignore`.

{MOBILE_SECTION_IF_DETECTED:
### 17. 📱 {MOBILE_FRAMEWORK} App Hygiene

[CONDITIONAL: Only include if a mobile framework was detected]

{CAPACITOR_SPECIFIC_IF_DETECTED:
Verify Capacitor integration health:

- **Direct `Capacitor.isNativePlatform()` calls**: Should use centralized platform detection utility instead
- **Direct `window.open` calls**: Should use the designated URL-opening hook for cross-platform compatibility
- **Stale `google-services.json`**: Verify Firebase config matches current project
- **`AndroidManifest.xml` drift**: Check for obsolete permissions, outdated intent filters, or missing declarations
- **Build version mismatch**: Verify `versionName` in `build.gradle` matches `version` in the root manifest
- **Orphaned Capacitor plugins**: Check `capacitor.config.ts` and manifests for plugins installed but not used
- **CI/CD secrets alignment**: Verify mobile build CI workflow secret references match configured secrets
}

{REACT_NATIVE_SPECIFIC_IF_DETECTED:
Verify React Native integration health:

- **Native module consistency**: Check that all linked native modules in `ios/Podfile` and `android/app/build.gradle` match installed packages
- **Platform-specific file pairing**: Verify `.ios.ts` / `.android.ts` files have corresponding generic counterparts
- **Metro config**: Check for stale Metro bundler configuration entries
- **Version consistency**: Verify `version` in `package.json` matches version codes in `android/app/build.gradle` and `ios/Info.plist`
}
}

| Component / File | Type of Opportunity | Details | Priority |
|:----------------|:--------------------|:--------|:--------|
| `path/to/file` | e.g., Custom dialog overlay | Uses custom modal instead of native `<dialog>` | Low/Med/High |
| `path/to/file` | e.g., Hardcoded font | References external font family | Low/Med/High |
| `path/to/file` | e.g., Unused animation import | Framer Motion imported but not used | Low/Med/High |
}

### 🔌 MCP Live Verification Results

> Only include this section if MCP servers were detected in workspace analysis.
> List only rows for MCP tools that are actually configured.

| Tool / Command | Query / Pattern | Result | Action |
|:-----|:----------------|:-------|:-------|
{DB_MCP_ROW_IF_DETECTED: | `{DB_MCP_TOOL}` | Tables in schema vs model files | _(result)_ | Orphaned tables? |}
{DB_INDEX_MCP_ROW_IF_DETECTED: | `{DB_MCP_TOOL}` | Index coverage on FK columns | _(result)_ | Missing indexes? |}
{CACHE_MCP_ROW_IF_DETECTED: | `{CACHE_MCP_TOOL}` | `{QUEUE_KEY_PATTERN}` | _(result)_ | Stale/failed jobs? |}
| `git log -1 --format="%cd" -- <file>` (terminal) | Files not touched in 90+ days | _(result)_ | Safe to delete? |
{GITHUB_MCP_ROW_IF_DETECTED: | `call_mcp_tool` (github-mcp-server) | `search_code` imports of flagged orphans | _(result)_ | References found? |}

## Execution Rules

1. **Report first, then confirm** — Do not delete anything without user approval
2. **Archive over delete** — Move questionable files to a temporary holding area if uncertain
3. **Update documentation** — If removing features, update relevant docs
4. **Run type-check after** — Verify no breakage with `{TYPE_CHECK_COMMAND}`

## Recommended Actions with AI Model Selection

For each cleanup action identified, recommend an appropriate AI model and Antigravity mode:

| Priority | Action | Effort | Files Affected | Recommended Model | Mode |
|:---------|:-------|:------:|:---------------|:------------------|:----:|
| 🔴 High | *cleanup action* | Low/Med/High | *file list* | *model name* | Fast/Planning |
| 🟡 Medium | *cleanup action* | Low/Med/High | *file list* | *model name* | Fast/Planning |
| 🟢 Low | *cleanup action* | Low/Med/High | *file list* | *model name* | Fast/Planning |

### Model Selection Rationale

For the model recommendations in the Recommended Actions table, use the **AI Model Orchestration** section from the agent's global rules (GEMINI.md). This includes the full model roster, recommended Antigravity modes (Fast/Planning), and the escalation path.

Match actions to models based on complexity:
- Bulk deletions and simple cleanups → fastest available model (Fast mode)
- Precision deletion and type safety work → mid-tier reasoning model (Planning mode)
- Complex refactoring requiring architectural decisions → deep reasoning model (Planning mode)
